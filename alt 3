    ALT3 – Modelling and Simulation :
    
    <br>
    <p/>Spreading Rumours in School Using Agent-Based Modelling.<p/>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      in computer science, <u> modelling </u> is when we make a simple version of a real-world thing, like a system, situation, or process. This simple version is called a model. A model helps us understand, test, and play around with something complicated by focusing only on the most important parts.
      
      
<p/> A <u>simulation </u> is when we run that model on a computer to see what happens over time. It shows us how the model behaves and helps us answer questions like: "What if this happened instead?" or "How will this change affect the result?"<p/>
 <strong></strong> 
    </div>
    <p>
     
    </p>In this project, I created a model that shows how rumours spread in a school. This is a real-life situation that many students have seen. I used a type of simulation called agent-based modelling, which means every student is an agent who makes their own decisions and acts independently. They can talk to each other, and if one of them knows a rumour, they might pass it on.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What are Agents and Emergent Behaviour?</h2>
   <div class="highlight">
   	An agent is a person or thing in the simulation that follows simple rules.

    <u> In this project, each student is an agent.</u>
   <strong></strong> 
    </div>
    <p>
     
     <p/> •	A student either knows the rumour or doesn’t. </p>
<p/> •	Students randomly talk to other students.<p/>
<p/>•	If a student knows the rumour, they might share it with the other student.<p/>
<p/>•	When lots of agents follow simple rules, something big can happen. This is called emergent behaviour.<p/>

<div class="colour-box">

  <p>For example, a few students know the rumour. They tell others, who then tell more. In a short time, the whole school might know the rumour. That’s emergent behaviour: a big result from small actions. <p/>
  
</div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Emergent Behaviour:</strong> When many agents follow simple rules, something big can happen. For example, a small rumour can spread through the whole school!

    <h2>Response to Brief</h2>
    <p>I chose to simulate the <strong>spread of rumours in school</strong> because it’s something many students can relate to. I wanted to learn how fast rumours can spread, and what changes the speed. I expect to find out that a rumour can spread very quickly, even if it starts with just one person. I also want to see what happens if fewer people share it, or if only a few people hear it at the beginning.</p>

    <h2>Design and Pseudocode</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
I created a list of students (agents). Some of them were randomly picked to start with the rumour. Then, for a number of steps (like time passing), students talked to others and spread the rumour. I started by roughly drafting a pseudocode to help make the flowchart easier.</p>
      <li>    Choose a few to start with the rumour</li>
      <li>	Create a list of students (True = knows rumour, False = doesn’t)
<li>   	Choose a few students to start with the rumour</li>
<li>	For each student who knows the rumour :</li>
<li>	Talk to a few random students</li>
<li>	If the other student doesn’t know it:</li>
<li>	Use random chance to see if they learn it</li>
<li>	Count how many students know the rumour</li>
<li>	Plot the results on a graph</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Agent-based modelling is very helpful when we want to understand how things spread or grow in a group.  we tell each agent (student) what to do. Then we let them act on their own. From their actions, we can see how the whole group behaves.</p>
<strong>This kind of modelling is used for:</strong>
<li>	Spreading diseases</li>
<li>	Sharing information</li>
<li>	Moving through a crowd</li>
<p>
<strong>Emergent behaviour</strong> ( When many agents follow simple rules, something big can happen) <strong>for example :</strong><p>
<p> 1.   	one person tells two others</p>
<p>	2.      Those two tell four more </p>
<p>3.       Then eight, sixteen, and so on</p>
<p>4.      Very quickly, a simple rumour can reach the whole school. Nobody planned it, but it still happened. 

<p>That’s why agent-based modelling is perfect for this simulation!!<p>

    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p> My code uses random numbers to make the simulation realistic. Each student has a chance to talk to others and share the rumour. I use a list of students and loop through them.
The program runs for 10 time steps, and at each step, it checks who spreads the rumour.<p>

  <section>
    <h2>Analysis of Inputs & Predictions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher chance to share = faster spreading</li>
      <li>More starters = wider spread</li>
      <li>More conversations = quicker spread</li>
      <li>Bigger school = takes longer to reach everyone</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This shows how small changes can make a big difference!</p>
